So on and so forth.\nI would say that the thing I've enjoyed the most from this experience is the people I have met. Everyone at codeworks is pretty great. Its refreshing being around so many people that are striving for something better. I haven't had that kind of positive energy in a long while.")])])}),[],!1,null,null,null);t.default=n.exports}}]);
